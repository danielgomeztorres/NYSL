		<h2>Northside Youth Soccer League</h2>
		<h2 class="colortituloreglas">RULES OF PLAY &amp; POLICIES</h2>
		<p> FIFA rules shall govern NYSL play except as modified herein.</p>
		<h3 class="h3reglas">SPORTSMANSHIP </h3>
		<ul class="puntoslista">
			<li><span class="normaltext">The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire
					youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player,
					coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior
					detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of
					technical soccer background, expertise, accomplishments or standing. </span></li>
		</ul>
		<h3 class="h3reglas"> FIFA FIELD REGULATIONS</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>DIMENSIONS.<span class="normaltext"> FIFA Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions
					within a given maximum and minimum width and length. These
					dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12
					and older.</span></li>
			<li>COMPETITION FIELDS.<span class="normaltext"> Fields used within the competition program must
					be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards. Leagues, districts or associations
					participating in the state competition program that are unable to provide a
					field that meets these minimum requirements must advise the State
					Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the
					field and recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum
					dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or
					associations that are unable to provide an acceptable field may be
					required to play all their games away.</span></li>
			<li>FIELDS USED BY YOUNG AGE GROUPS.<span class="normaltext">
					<ol class="listaletras">
						<li><span class="normaltext">U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no penalty
								areas. Fields for older age groups should be progressively larger.</span></li>
						<li><span class="normaltext">U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards width.</span></li>
						<li><span class="normaltext">U-10 play on a field 70-80 yards in length and 40-50 yards in width.</span></li>
						<li><span class="normaltext">In addition, fields used by young age groups may have their internal
								dimensions and size of goal similarly modified.</span></li>
					</ol>
				</span>
			</li>


			<li>TEAM BENCH AREAS<span class="normaltext">
					<ol class="listaletras">
						<li>
							Recreation &amp;District Programs
							<ul class="puntoslista">
								<li><span class="normaltext">The decision for team/spectator placement on the field will
										be made by the governing body of that team. A team’s
										bench area shall consist of that area at least one (1) yard
										away from the touchline and extending to twenty yards (20)
										both ways from the halfway line. In the event that field
										2
										conditions require team benches to be on the same side of
										the field, a team’s bench area shall consist of that area two
										(2) yards away from the touchline and extending twenty
										yards one (1) way from the halfway line.</span></li>
								<li><span class="normaltext">The home team has first choice as to where it wishes to
										locate its bench area. Coaches and substitutes are required
										to remain within their bench area during the game. Parents
										and spectators should occupy the same side of the field as
										the team they are supporting.</span></li>
							</ul>
						</li>

						<li>
							State Competition League Only
							<ul class="puntoslista">
								<li><span class="normaltext">Except where it is determined by the referee to be
										impractical, team bench areas shall be along the same
										touchline. Each team bench area shall be located two yards
										outside the touchline, beginning not closer than five yards
										from midfield and extending not further than twenty yards
										from midfield. The home team shall have the right to choose
										the location of its bench area. Coaches and substitutes must
										remain within their team's bench area during the game.</span></li>
								<li><span class="normaltext">Parents and spectators must occupy the sideline opposite
										the team bench areas. Supporters of a team must assemble
										on the side of the midfield facing the team bench area of that
										team. There shall be a buffer zone extending ten yards on
										each side of the midfield that may not be occupied by
										parents or spectators. Match officials shall be empowered to
										enforce these provisions and may suspend or terminate
										games in the event that any team, coach, parent, or
										spectator declines to abide by requests from match officials
										to comply with these standards.</span></li>
